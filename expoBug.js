This error occurs when using Expo CLI and you try to run the app on a device or simulator that isn't compatible with the project's configuration.  For instance, you might have specified a certain minimum iOS version, but are trying to run it on an older device. Another possibility is a mismatch between your project's EAS build configuration and the device you're targeting, especially regarding architectures (arm64, x86_64).
