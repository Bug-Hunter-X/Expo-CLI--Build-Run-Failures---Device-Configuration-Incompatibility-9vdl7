The solution involves carefully examining and updating your `app.json` or EAS build configuration. If using EAS Build, make sure the build profile matches your target device's architecture and OS version. For instance, if you're targeting an older iOS device, you might need to adjust the `minSdkVersion` in your `app.json`.  If targeting both arm64 and x86_64 architectures, ensure that your EAS build configuration caters to both. After making necessary changes, a clean build is often required (`expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android`). Also ensure that the project's dependencies are compatible with the target platform versions.
